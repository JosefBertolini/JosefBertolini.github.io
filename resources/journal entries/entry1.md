## The First Entry: My First Foray in Web Development
Today is the first day where I started the construction of my website. As of right now, I'm only implementing the HTML portion of the site, the super-cool styling and brains will come later. Its been a long time since I've written any HTML, the last time was about 7 years ago when I was a freshman in High School. It wasn't *too* hard to pick back up, the main thing is I just hate how plain and ugly un-styled HTML looks; plus, the *emmet* tool helps speed up the act of typing up the documents. 
Part of me hopes that I didn't get over ambitious for my website. Don't get me wrong, I definitely believe that this is a worthwhile project, but, I do worry that I could be using my time to be doing something closer to game development since that is what I want to get into. I think it will work out, I think the main part I'm worried about is the *CSS* portion will explode in complexity and I'll get stuck with an ugly website.
Well, despite my concerns, I'm off to get back to writing some HTML.

Take Care and Happy Coding,
Joe
