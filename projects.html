                            <p>This is honestly on of my favorite projects to work on, and it solidified my desire to pursue systems programming as a potential career path. The finished product (still had a few bugs but) was able to support an arbitrary number of concurrent users and rooms, and the source clocked in at just over 2500 lines of code.</p>

                            <p>In a team of 6, we created a 2D top-down Beat 'em Up game about Black Friday shopping gone wrong. I was personally responsible for creating and implementing the weapon and combat systems for the game, including different types of melee weapons as well as firearms.

                            <p>I wrote a compiler for a simple LLVM language called <em>Crux</em>. The compiler is written in Java and uses real world tools like ANTLR4. The project covers all aspects of a compiler: grammar, the AST, static type checking, creating the IR, and generating x86_64 assembly code. The language itself supports function definition, recursion, control flow structures, ans strong typing with static scoping with variable shadowing.</p>
                            <p>Being 100% honest, this was the most difficult project I have ever worked on at that point in time, but I loved every bit of it. It challenged all of the concepts of programming that I knew as well as introducing new concepts, like <em>Reflection</em> (however I have done more advanced Reflection programming since) and using an IDE debugger. I kinda shot myself in the foot because this was a pair project that I chose to do by myself, but I enjoyed the challenge that came of it, so I don't mind.</p>

Originally, players were going to be playing against an AI but we couldn't get that done within the classes time constraints.</p>

                            <p>This is a game we made for the IGDA 2020 eJam, a 48 hour game jame with a theme of celebration. Originally, it was going to take place in a world overrun by demons and you play as a human slave cooking their dinner, and secretly trying to poison them. But that didn't fit the theme. This game is meant to prototype a larger project we want to work on, and I think it came out pretty good for the time spent on it.</p>
                            <p>This is a typing game where you play as a chef at Benihana during a Halloween party. In this game, you need to type commands, and quickly, to cook food and keep your guests entertained. For this project I did most of the scripting responsible for Input and handling matching and reacting to correct input as well as some of the UI. It was a fun project to work on, and I'm proud of what the team was able to put together</p>

                            <p>This game was made as an entry to the 2020 Colorado Lottery Game Jam, where the challenge was to make a new, creative kind of monitor game. This game won 2nd prize among the 30 games presented. It was really fun to work on as much as it was a nightmare since we changed our design about 4 times during the jam.</p>

                            <p>Created a Rasterizer in C++ that can trace primitive shapes in a given scene and outputs a PGM image. The program uses a custom file type to create the scene, where you can define the viewport size and location, light point, and location of shapes. I created this project using OOP principles with some new (at the time) features of C++17. The programing runs with an arbitrary amount of threads without encountering any data races or deadlocks and is about 70% faster on average than the single threaded version.</p>
                            <p>This was a fun project that I made over the course of a couple days. Ironically, the hardest parts of the project was reading the physics equations correctly. This was the first time I wrote a multi-threaded program, and it was very intimidating, but working on the project, as well as some other ones after, really demystified concurrency and helped turn it into a valuable skill.</p>

                            <p>My first delve into HTML after 7 years. I wanted to make my own website just to see what it was like. Honestly, I found it fairly tedious writing the HTML, but styling it all with CSS was equal parts fun, rewarding, and aggravating. Probably wont make another website anytime soon.</p>
                            <p>This website is made with raw HTML5 and CSS3 over the course of about 3 collective days of working on it, I got distracted by other projects (that I'll add here when I'm done with them).</p>
