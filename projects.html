                        <p>This was a game made in Unity in about 3 weeks for a class at UCI, ICS 161. I'm most proud of this project, given the quality of the game and features like original sounds effects and music. The game runs on all platforms, so please check it out!</p>
                        <p>In a team of 6, we created a 2D top-down Beat 'em Up game about Black Friday shopping gone wrong. I was personally responsible for creating and implementing the weapon and combat systems for the game, including different types of melee weapons as well as firearms.

This has been the longest project I've worked on, and its been the most ambitious I've worked on too. This project is still in progress, and we have lots of plans to add to the game.</p>
                        <p>In a team of 5, we created an Android game that acts like a hybrid of W.O.R.M.S. and Angry Birds. This is an online PvP game where players shoot rocks out of cannons to destroy other players bases and rocks. My portion of the project is the gameplay programming, more specifically the power ups and behavior of objects in the game, and the controls as well.</p>

                        <p>This is a game we made for the IGDA 2020 eJam, a 48 hour game jame with a theme of celebration. Originally, it was going to take place in a world overrun by demons and you play as a human slave cooking their dinner, and secretly trying to poison them. But that didn't fit the theme. This game is meant to prototype a larger project we want to work on, and I think it came out pretty good for the time spent on it.</p>
                        <p>This is a typing game where you play as a chef at Benihana during a Halloween party. In this game, you need to type commands, and quickly, to cook food and keep your guests entertained. For this project I did most of the scripting responsible for Input and handling matching and reacting to correct input as well as some of the UI. It was a fun project to work on, and I'm proud of what the team was able to put together</p>

                        <p>I wrote a compiler for a simple LLVM language called <em>Crux</em>. The compiler is written in Java and uses real world tools like ANTLR4. The project covers all aspects of a compiler: grammar, the AST, static type checking, creating the IR, and generating x86_64 assembly code. The language itself supports function definition, recursion, control flow structures, ans strong typing with static scoping with variable shadowing.</p>
                        <p>Being 100% honest, this was the most difficult project I have ever worked on, but I loved every bit of it. It challenged all of the concepts of programming that I knew as well as introducing new concepts, like <em>Reflection</em> (however I have done more advanced Reflection programming since) and using an IDE debugger. I kinda shot myself in the foot because this was a pair project that I chose to do by myself, but I enjoyed the challenge that came of it, so I don't mind.</p>

                        <p>This is a monitor game designed to be played in bars and restaurants. In this game players bet on what gems come out of a treasure chest that randomly generates a set of 5 gems. Players can attempt to match 3, 4, or 5 of the gems in any order to win, but if they also match the sequence of gems they get double the prize.</p>
                        <p>This game was made as an entry to the 2020 Colorado Lottery Game Jam, where the challenge was to make a new, creative kind of monitor game. This game won 2nd prize among the 30 games presented. It was really fun to work on as much as it was a nightmare since we changed our design about 4 times during the jam.</p>

                        <p>Created a Rasterizer in C++ (soon Rust, too) that can trace primitive shapes in a given scene and outputs a PGM image. The program uses a custom file type to create the scene, where you can define the viewport size and location, light point, and location of shapes. I created this project using OOP principles with some new (at the time) features of C++17. The programing runs with an arbitrary amount of threads without encountering any data races or deadlocks and is about 70% faster on average than the single threaded version.</p>
                        <p>This was a fun project that I made over the course of a couple days. Ironically, the hardest parts of the project was reading the physics equations correctly. This was the first time I wrote a multi-threaded program, and it was very intimidating, but working on the project, as well as some other ones after, really demystified concurrency and helped turn it into a valuable skill.</p>

                        <p>During my 3rd year at UCI I took a class where we went over many different styles and features of different programming languages and patterns. To practice with languages and styles, I reimplemented most of the Python 3 examples in <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/exercises-in-programming/9781482227376/" target="_blank"><em><u>the pictured textbook</u></em></a> in C++ and Java, usually about 2 examples each week. Each week has its own folder in the repl directory.</p>
                        <p>I listed this here for 2 reasons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1) I challenged myself to take a unique (potentially impractical) solution each time I worked on a new example.</li> 
                            <br>
                            <li>2) In each example, I had to use a lot of neat tricks to get around C++ static typing (including the first time I ever used <code>constexpr</code>). I think it is a good sign of my ingenuity as programmer and my ability to solve unusual problems.</li>
