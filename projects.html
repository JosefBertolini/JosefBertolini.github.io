        <p>This was a game made in Unity in about 3 weeks for a class at UCI, ICS 161. I'm most proud of this project, given the quality of the game and features like original sounds effects and music. The game runs on all platforms, so please check it out!</p>
        <p>In a team of 6, we created a 2D top-down Beat 'em Up game about Black Friday shopping gone wrong. I was personally responsible for creating and implementing the weapon and combat systems for the game, including different types of melee weapons as well as firearms.</p>

        <p>This is another game made in Unity for a class at UCI, ICS 167 & 168, and we plan to continue development in the fall in ICS 169. This has been the longest project I've worked on, and its been the most ambitious I've worked on too. This project is still in progress, and we have lots of plans to add to the game.</p>
        <p>In a team of 5, we created an Android game that acts like a hybrid of W.O.R.M.S. and Angry Birds. This is an online PvP game where players shoot rocks out of cannons to destroy other players bases and rocks. My portion of the project is the gameplay programming, more specifically the power ups and behavior of objects in the game, and the controls as well.</p>

        <h3>Rust Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
        <label></M><a href="https://github.com/JosefBertolini/RustTicTacToe" target="_blank">Link to Source</a></label>
        <p>A small project I did in late 2019 to get myself familiar with Rust. The GitHub only contains the source code, so to run it you will need to build it using cargo yourself</p>
        <p>Play Tic-Tac-Toe in the command line. This is a really simple program that enables you to play Tic-Tac-Toe on your command line, there isn't any AI so you'll need a friend to play against.</p>

        <p>My first delve into HTML after 7 years. I wanted to make my own website just to see what it was like.</p>
        <p>This website is made with raw HTML5 and CSS3 over the course of the summer.</p>
