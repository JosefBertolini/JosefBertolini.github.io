                        <p>Hello! My name is Josef Bertolini, and I'm currently a 4th year student at University of California, Irvine. I'm a Computer Game Science major doubling in Computer Science and specializing in Systems and Software. When I'm not working, I'm also and an avid gamer, and what I want to do with my career is to combine my love of playing games and my love of writing code and making software into a career of making great video games.</p> 
                        <p>I've been programming for about 3 years, which is when I started college. I started with Python 3, and then eventually moved on to C++ (my preferred language) and then Java. The other tool I primarily use is the Unity 5 game engine; all my games have been made using this engine. I've dabbled in other programming languages as well, such as Lisp, C, and Prolog. Now my goal is to learn Rust, the idea of systems level speed with application level safety is very intriguing to me, and to learn how to use the Unreal Engine, since it's a more professionally used game engine. 
                        </p>

                                Took part in running a two day workshop where we taught a group of High School students the basic concepts of both designing games and developing games using Unity.

                                My job was mainly focused on the development portion of the workshop, where me and my fellow volunteers showed the students the basics of making games with Unity.

                                More specifically, I covered making scripts and creating objects that utilize the scripts and explaining the Entity-Component System that Unity uses. I also covered making animations and making transitions.
