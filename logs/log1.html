		<p class="log-paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;I went to college for a Computer Science degree for one reason: to make video games as a career. Right now, I'm not doing that. Right now, I'm working for a ad serving company doing web development, which is something I said I wouldn't do.... but I wasn't ready for game dev and needed to pay the bills. I knew from 1) the lack of response from most game studios I applied 2) the embarassment I felt from failing interview questions that felt like gimmes. I know my weakpoints, 3D math and "game programming". The "game programming" is a particularly infuriating one to me since I would have assumed that a major titled <strong><em>Computer Game Science</em></strong> would supply me with the proper knowledge to enter the industry but it doesn't and I realized too late. I don't want to put the blame the program completely since that just feels like blame shifting, and the past is the past and all I can influence is my future. To do that, I found some books that I'm going to read that somehow where not assigned during my undergrad: <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com" target="_blank">Game Programming Patterns</a> and <a href="https://gamemath.com" target="_blank">3D Math Primer for Game Development and Graphics</a> (kinda convenient that there are 2 books covering my exact weakpoints). I'll probably make a log saying how eye opening they are.</p>
		<p class="log-paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;I also will get back to working on the personal projects I've either started and put off working on and/or thought about and put off starting (Like my discord bot that just has a README.md and a LICENSE, like BRUH). I also need more non-school C++ projects to prove my knowledge of the langauge, since right now my resume just says I know it, but I need to back it up with something, so look out for a log/new project entry for whatever that/those turn(s) out to be.</p>
