                <p class="log-paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;What am going to be doing? Truth be told, I don't know; If I code something that I think is cool, I'll write about it; Maybe a rant or two; I might write about games because I like playing and making those. I just fell the need to write.... something. Being out of school, I don't really have a circle/audience to share my thoughts about programming and projects so now I'm talking to you. I have some ideas for some fun projects, and I want to share my thoughts with people. Not because I think my thoughts are pure gold and you should be considering yourself lucky for gracing your mind with them, but because I believe learning is a collaborative experience. Maybe something I write could spark someone's train of thought, help them solve a bug, get them to stop using Java, there are lots of possibilities. Plus, maybe writing my own logs will keep me reading other people's (b)logs.</p>
                <p class="log-paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;I have a couple ideas for future logs, including but not limited to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Go, almost the perfect language</li>
                        <li>Interpreted Languages, not made for entire applications</li>
                        <li><em>JavaScript</em> (said like <em>Dinkleberg</em>)</li>
                        <li>Probably something about Rust</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="log=paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;Am I qualified to make definitive claims on these topics? No, but I'm not trying to, just communicating my thoughts. Don't like 'em? Love 'em? Shoot me an email response or a message on Discord, I might respond in another log!</p>
