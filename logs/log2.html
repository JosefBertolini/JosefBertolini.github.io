		    &emsp;&emsp;I don't know how much longer I can keep going. The way I'm phrasing it makes it seem more morbid than it actually is, but I still feel it's justified. I used to love programming; well "used to" is a pretty strong way to phrase it. I still do, but I went from spending extra time when doing the programming projects because I enjoyed working on them not really minding the fact that I was doing homework and doing stricly for-fun projects to dreading being asked to work in a different repo/on a different project at work. I should've seen this coming, honestly. When I took the fullstack class in uni I hated working on the project, but I think I put almost of the blame on Java, or I had thought that if I was being paid to do it I would enjoy it. The feeling I get is similar to playing a very grindy JRPG game, oddly enough. I'm just going through the motions of something that needs to be done rather than actively trying something I actually want to do. Maybe that's why I never play those kinds of games.

		    &emsp;&emsp;To be completely fair to my job, I wasn't originally doing web stuff when I started; it just sorta ended up being that way. Once the project I maintained was feature complete I got pulled onto other things. I've thought about bringing it up with my lead and/or looking at other teams to potentially switch to, but my team is effectively being cut in half from other's thinking the same. I've also started interviewing again, and I'd hate to go through all the trouble to transfer to then just leave all together. Eh, I'll figure it out eventually... hopefully soon.
